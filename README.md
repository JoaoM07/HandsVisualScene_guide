# HandsVisualScene_guide
This repo contains the Jupyter notebooks developed in Google Colab to replicate our data analysis on the paper "O hand, where art thou? Mapping hand location across the visual field during common activities". Each notebook contains the instructions for the necessary steps to be able to run our analysis, including which data to download and respective folder structure.
